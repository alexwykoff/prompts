i want to create an MVP project which is [CORE FEATURE]. IDs are handled by the ATProtocol and [SOME FEATURE] is handled by [SOME EXISTING LIBRARY]. 

the user flow is as such:
1. the user signs in with their bluesky ID or creates a new one if they don't have one
2. screen 2
3. screen 3
4. screen 4
5. screen 5

i want this to be a JAMStack compliant project which uses static html, css, and javascript files. i want to be able to deploy this project to IPFS, a usb stick, or a cloud server.

provide step-by-step instructions on how to build this. atproto docs are here: @https://atproto.com/ 
[SOME FEATURE] docs are here: [SOME LINK]


make sure to test if each piece works along the way. ask clarifying questions up front to be sure you understand the assignment and how to implement it.

create a mapping.md doc so you can keep track of the layout of files and folders and their relationship to the project.

preferably this project uses the minimal amount of files necessary to complete the job. it should be simple and elegant.

create a PLAN.md that has the complete implementation plan with a fully detailed checklist so you can keep track of your progress along the way. 

this prompt will exist in PROMPT.md if you ever need a refresher
